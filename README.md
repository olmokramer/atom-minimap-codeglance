# styling the codeglance element

You can style the codeglance element from your stylesheet (`~/.atom/styles.less`) like this:

```less
minimap-codeglance {
  // see through the codeglance element
  opacity: .8;
  // change the shadow of the element
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
  // etc.
}
```
